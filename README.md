This repo contains all the projects that I have done in the alx-Holberton curriculum on Higher level programming.

## What Does High-Level Language (HLL) Mean?
A high-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.


## Acknowledgements üôè
All work contained in this project was completed as part of the curriculum for the ALX-SE programme. `ALX Africa` is an online full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning. 

## Technologies:technologist:
- Shell Scripts are written in Bash 4
- Python Scripts are written with Python 3
- MySQL 8.0 (version 8.0)
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
## Resourses:building_construction:
You will find the resources of each project under the directory folder.
